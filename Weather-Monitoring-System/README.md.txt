# Weather Monitoring System

## Description
A simple implementation for a **Weather Monitoring System** that helps us keep track of weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The system allows various parts of the system to respond automatically when the weather changes(changes are random). For example, if the temperature gets too hot, an alert might be triggered.
